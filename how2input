Journal entries can be accomplished by manual entry (the 1. Journal
Entry secondary menu option) or by specifying a file from which the
entries can be read (the 2. Load Journal Entries from file menu
option.)


1. Manual entry:  the user is prompted for entries.

2. Specified input file:
    Such an input file must be of the format exemplified by the
file 'tests/debk.d/Manero_input0'.
    More specifically:
     I) Each entry must be separated from another by a blank line.
    II) Each entry consists, in order, of the following lines:
    II.a) one date line (any format you like.)
    II.b) one line containing the ID of the one making the entry.
    II.c) one or more lines of explanatory text.
    II.d) Two or more line entries in the following format:
            account(s), ' Dr ' or ' Cr ', an_amount
        'account(s)' can be specified as one of the following:
             i) a single account code,
            ii) a coma separated list of account codes,
           iii) two account codes separated by the character
             defined by src.config.ACCOUNT_RANGE_SPECIFIER.
        The latter multiple account formats (ii and iii) can be
        used to distribute/divide (as evenly as possible) one
        amount among several accounts.
        For a line entry to be recognized as such, the 'Dr' or 'Cr'
        must have a space on either side of it (to separate it from
        the preceding account(s) and the subsequent amount.)
        An unavoidable corollary of this is that no line of
        explanatory text can contain a ' Dr ' or a ' Cr ' sequence!
