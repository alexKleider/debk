Journal entries can be accomplished by manual entry (the 1. Journal
Entry secondary menu option) or by specifying a file from which the
entries can be read (the 2. Load Journal Entries from file menu
option.)


1. Manual entry:  the user is prompted for entries.

2. Specified input file:
    Such an input file must be of the format exemplified by the
file 'tests/debk.d/Manero_input0'.
    More specifically:
     I) Each entry must be separated from another by a blank line.
    II) Each entry consists, in order, of the following lines:
    II.a) one date line (any format you like.)
    II.b) one line containing the ID of the one making the entry.
    II.c) one or more lines of text explaining the entry.
    II.d) Two or more lines following the following format:
            account(s), 'Dr' or 'Cr', and an amount.
        'account(s)' can either be a single account code or multiple
        accounts can be specified in one of the following ways:
             i) a coma separated (no white space) list of account
             codes.
            ii) two account codes separated by a dash ('-') specifies
            as a range of accounts.)
        The multiple account formats alow one to (as evenly as
        possible) distribute one amount amongst several accounts.
