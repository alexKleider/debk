Rather than do data entry manually, I've used redirection to load the
journal entries.
The whole thing can be further automated using a small bash script.
See k15.sh for my example.  

The following are the rules one must follow when building an input file.
(The file 'input' provides an example; it's the file I've been using.)


There must be 2 blank lines between the last Credit line of the last
entry and the final 'yes'.

There must be one blank line between last Credit of one entry and
the date of the next entry.

Each entry consists of:
    date
    user
    description lines
    one blank line
      (to signal that there are no more description lines to enter)
    two or more triple lines:
        first is account code
        second is debit entry   { Use zero if there is
        third is credit entry   {  no value to enter.
    a blank line (to signal end of the entry-
            Referrece to this line was already made above.)
