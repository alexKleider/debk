problem with 
./src/debk.py
......
file too long
results from there not being a shebang line.

The shebang line to use is
#!./venv/bin/python
as long as the venv has been set up and activated 
in the project (in my case: /home/alex/debk) directory.


Alternatively, problem can be circumvented (not
recommended) by prefacing the command with python
