problem with 
./src/debk.py
......
file too long
results from there not being a shebang line and can be circumvented
by adding one or by prefacing the command with 
python

The shebang line to use is
#!../venv/bin/python
as long as the venv has been activated.
#!../../venv/bin/python
will also work but will be the ~/Py/venv 
rather than the ~/Py/CSV/venv
