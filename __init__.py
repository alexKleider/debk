Package "debk" stands for what it does: Double Entry Book Keeping.

Inspired by my interest in learning the basics of double entry book
keeping and wanting to keep track of the accounting for our 2015 canoe
trip (party of 10.)  Glen Jarvis has been working on a double entry
book keeping system and has described some of his design criteria 
to me.  His commitment to haveing all data editable by hand struck me
as being an interesting idea in keeping with the "Unix way."

All persistent data is kept in CSV or jason files.
