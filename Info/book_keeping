A Guide to Elementary Accounting by Pyle, Larson, Hermanson (1970, 1979 & 1981)

Fundamental Accounting Equation
    assets: properties of concern
    equities: rights in assets
    An asset is something of value owned.
    Ownership of an asset gives its owner(s) certain rights and these
    rights are called "equities" and have value.
  Relationship between property and property rights:
    Value of the assets (of a business) = Value of the equities in the assets
            or
    Assets = Equities
  Buisnesses generally require more assets than owners can provide so
  the difference must be made up by borrowing or buying assets on credit
  from "creditors" who then have a claim against the assets or a right
  in the assets (of the busines.)
  Creditor claims are called "liabilities" and take precedentce over
  those of owners.
    Assets = Liabilities + Owner Equity
    Assets - Liabilities = Owner Equity
    Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth
  Terms often treated synonymously: 
    Net Worth
    Owner Equity
    Proprietorship

Transactions Affect the Accounting Equation
    Accounting records are based on the business entity concept: a
    business is separate and distinct from owner or owners.
    The business is treated as though it owns its own assets and in
    turn owes its creditors and owner(s) the amounts of their claims.
    *Keep businesses separate and don't mix in personal transactions!

    The "Cost Principle": It is the transaction price that sets the
    value of a product or service.

    When buying on credit:
    Post to Assets and to Liabilities: Accounts Payable
    When selling:
    Post ot Assets:Item in question and to
    Assets:Cash +/or Assets:Accounts Receivable

    Revenue: inflow of asset(s) in exchange for goods or services.
    Expenses: goods and services consumed in generation of revenue.
    These increase/decrease net assets and owner equity.

Chapter 2: The Recording of Transactions
========================================

The Account
-----------
A book keeping device often in 'T' form used in recording and
summarizing the increases and decreases in a single asset, liability
or owner equity item. Securing the "balance of the account."

The Ledger
----------
A group of accounts used to record transactions.
Accounts commonly used
----------------------
  Asset Accounts
    Cash
    Notes Receivable (promissory notes)
    Accounts Receivable (sales on credit/sales on account)
    Prepaid Expenses
    Equipment
    Buildings
    Land
  Liability Accounts
    Notes Payable (promissory notes)
    Accounts Payable
    Other Short Term Payables (wages, taxes, interest)
    Mortgage Payable
  Owner Equity Accounts
    Capital
    Withdrawls
    Revenue and Expense

Debit & Credit
--------------
"Dr" to left and "Cr to right of 'T'
Difference between the two totals is either
a credit or a debit balance.
Note: debit/credit != increase/decrease
Debit = place in left column
Credit = place in right column

Mechanics of Double Entry Book Keeping
======================================
Every transaction affects and is recorded in two or more accounts with
equal totals of debits and credits!
Equality of debits and credits is made possible by recording 
increases in liabilities and owner equity as credits &
increases in assets as debits.  Conversely,
decreases in liability and owner equity accounts => debit &
decreases in assets => credit
        Assets         =      Liabilities       +      Owner Equity
----------v-----------   ----------v-----------   ----------v-----------
Debit for | Credit for   Debit for | Credit for   Debit for | Credit for
Increases | Decreases    Decreases | Increases    Decreases | Increases    

Need for a journal! Transactions are recorded initially in a journal
then trasferred to respective ledger accounts.
Journal: book of original entry.
Ledger: book of final entry.

General Journal- simplest and most flexible:
For each transaction places are provided for recording
1. Date
2. Names of accounts involved
3. Explanation of transaction
4. Account numbers
5. Debit and Credit effect on accounts named

Posting: act of recording journal entries to the general ledger.

Ch 3. Adjusting Entries & Statement Preparation
===============================================

Accounting Periods- equal length, often 1yr (possibly quarterly...)
Financial statements prepared at the end of each accounting period
include both an Income Statement and a Balance Sheet.
Income Statement: shows the income or loss for the period
Balance Sheet: reports end-of-period financial position by listing
assets owned, liabilities owed and the equity of the owner(s).
Both are prepared from information accumulated in the accounts of the
business.

Income Statement
Lists revenue earned, expenses incurred and the net income or loss for
the specified period. The heading must contain the name of the
business and the period covered.
A _classified_ income statement is one in which revenues and expenses
are classified by function.

Balance Sheet
A statement prepared to show the financial position of a business
as of a specific date listing assets and claims against these assets.

Classification of Balance Sheet Items
-------------------------------------
Current Assets
Long Term Investments (securities held to be converted to cash but not
within current accounting period)
Fixed Assets (office equipment, buildings, land)
Intangible Assets (good will, patents, trademarks)
Deferred Charges (long-term prepaid expenses)
Current Liabilities (notes, accounts, wages, taxes & interest payable;
unearned revenues)
Long Term Liabilities (mortgages and bonds payable)

Owner Equity/Proprietorship/Net Worth/Capitol (all used synonymously)
Indicate the equity (of the owner(s) of a business) in the assets.
Manner of reporting owner equity depends on whether business is a
single proprietorship, a partnership or a corporation.

Adjustments to Accounts before Statement Preparation
Prepaid Expense: an asset that will be consumed becoming an expense
Unearned Revenues: 
Depreciation: purchase of a fixed asset == "fund of usefulness"
    ..converts asset to expense piecemeal over life of item
    Recorded in a 'contra account' i.e. accummulated depreciation
    A contra account is one which is subtracted from another account
    thus preserving the facts of an asset's cost and useful life.
Accrued Expenses: unpaid, unrecorded not yet due expenses
Accrued Revenues...

(Unadjusted) trial balance ==> Adjusted Trial Balance
Then prepare Income Statement which is needed to complete the owner's
equity section of the balance sheet.

Cash vs Accrual Basis of Accounting: Former used only when
inventories, receivables and payables are insignificant.
