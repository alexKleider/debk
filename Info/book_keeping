A Guide to Elementary Accounting by Pyle, Larson, Hermanson (1970, 1979 & 1981)

Fundamental Accounting Equation
    assets: properties of concern
    equities: rights in assets
    An asset is something of value owned.
    Ownership of an asset gives its owner(s) certain rights and these
    rights are called "equities" and have value.
  Relationship between property and property rights:
    Value of the assets (of a business) = Value of the equities in the assets
            or
    Assets = Equities
  Buisnesses generally require more assets than owners can provide so
  the difference must be made up by borrowing or buying assets on credit
  from "creditors" who then have a claim against the assets or a right
  in the assets (of the busines.)
  Creditor claims are called "liabilities" and take precedentce over
  those of owners.
    Assets = Liabilities + Owner Equity
    Assets - Liabilities = Owner Equity
    Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth
  Terms often treated synonymously: 
    Net Worth
    Owner Equity
    Proprietorship

Transactions Affect the Accounting Equation
    Accounting records are based on the business entity concept: a
    business is separate and distinct from owner or owners.
    The business is treated as though it owns its own assets and in
    turn owes its creditors and owner(s) the amounts of their claims.
    *Keep businesses separate and don't mix in personal transactions!

    The "Cost Principle": It is the transaction price that sets the
    value of a product or service.

    When buying on credit:
    Post to Assets and to Liabilities: Accounts Payable
    When selling:
    Post ot Assets:Item in question and to
    Assets:Cash +/or Assets:Accounts Receivable

    Revenue: inflow of asset(s) in exchange for goods or services.
    Expenses: goods and services consumed in generation of revenue.
    These increase/decrease net assets and owner equity.

Chapter 2: The Recording of Transactions
========================================

The Account
-----------
A book keeping device often in 'T' form used in recording and
summarizing the increases and decreases in a single asset, liability
or owner equity item. Securing the "balance of the account."

The Ledger
----------
A group of accounts used to record transactions.
Accounts commonly used
----------------------
  Asset Accounts
    Cash
    Notes Receivable (promissory notes)
    Accounts Receivable (sales on credit/sales on account)
    Prepaid Expenses
    Equipment
    Buildings
    Land
  Liability Accounts
    Notes Payable (promissory notes)
    Accounts Payable
    Other Short Term Payables (wages, taxes, interest)
    Mortgage Payable
  Owner Equity Accounts
    Capital
    Withdrawls
    Revenue and Expense

Debit & Credit
--------------
"Dr" to left and "Cr to right of 'T'
Difference between the two totals is either
a credit or a debit balance.
Note: debit/credit != increase/decrease
Debit = place in left column
Credit = place in right column

Mechanics of Double Entry Book Keeping
======================================
Every transaction affects and is recorded in two or more accounts with
equal totals of debits and credits!
Equality of debits and credits is made possible by recording 
increases in liabilities and owner equity as credits &
increases in assets as debits.  Conversely,
decreases in liability and owner equity accounts => debit &
decreases in assets => credit
        Assets         =      Liabilities       +      Owner Equity
----------v-----------   ----------v-----------   ----------v-----------
Debit for | Credit for   Debit for | Credit for   Debit for | Credit for
Increases | Decreases    Decreases | Increases    Decreases | Increases    

Need for a journal! Transactions are recorded initially in a journal
then trasferred to respective ledger accounts.
Journal: book of original entry.
Ledger: book of final entry.

General Journal- simplest and most flexible:
For each transaction places are provided for recording
1. Date
2. Names of accounts involved
3. Explanation of transaction
4. Account numbers
5. Debit and Credit effect on accounts named

Posting: act of recording journal entries to the general ledger.

Ch 3. Adjusting Entries & Statement Preparation
===============================================

Accounting Periods- equal length, often 1yr (possibly quarterly...)
Financial statements prepared at the end of each accounting period
include both an Income Statement and a Balance Sheet.
