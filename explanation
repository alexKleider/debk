EXPLANATION:
Journal entries appear in the first half of this file, 
followed in the second half by the ledger: a listing of entries
and balances for each account.
Place holder accounts are simply listed without any corresponding
entries or balances (except for 5001- explained below.)

The value of canoes and other "fixed assets" has been moved from
the equity to the liability accounts of the "group of 8" who are now
owners of the canoes, and other things bought.  Do not be alarmed by
the word "liability."  This does not mean a liability born by you.  It means 
that the "trip entity" owes you the value of those assets.  (The
liability is on the part of the trip entity.)
The equity accounts reflect how much of your initial investment
remains (or, if negative, how much you owe.)

The total of the expense accounts has been balanced against the equity
accounts of all the participants:
This was done by adding all the (typically Dr) expense entries, entering that
sum as a Cr entry in account 5001, and balancing that amount by equal
Dr entries in each of the participants equity accounts.

I believe this all to be in keeping with standard double entry book
keeping said to first have been devised by Franciscan friar Luca
Pacioli [1] (although there is some contoversy as to who was truely the
first [2].)

Other items that might be of interest:
1. Hauling the gear from Bolinas to Winnipeg:
    It proved to be only a three day journey each way.
    The return journey was by a different route to accommodate Keith's
    plans to visit friends in the mid West but it turns out that the 
    distance was little different, in fact a bit less although keep in
    mind that the inbound distance includes all the driving I did during
    the 5 days I spent in Winnipeg before others began arriving.
    Bolinas to Winnipeg: 2142mi, fuel cost US$419.84
    Winnipeg to Bolinas: 2101mi, .............392.51
    Totals               4243                 812.35

    Miles per gallon came in at 15.88 which is pretty good given that I
    was pulling a lot of weight in the trailer and that I generally get
    about 17mi/USGal.  Also, there was more in the tank when I returned
    than when I left which would make the true figure even higher.
