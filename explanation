EXPLANATION:
Journal entries appear in the first half of this file, 
followed in the second half by the ledger: a listing of entries
and balances for each account.
Place holder accounts are simply listed without any corresponding
entries or balances.  Accounts 1501 and 5001 are used for a special
purpose explained below.

The value of canoes and other "fixed assets" is reflected in the 
liability accounts of the eight participants who 'bought' them.
This was done by adding all the (typically Dr) fixed asset entries,
entering that sum as a Cr entry in account 1501 with a balancing Dr
entry distributed evenly among the Liability accounts of the 'group
of 8' who are now owners of these assets.  Do not be alarmed by the
word "liability."  This does not mean a liability born by you.
It means that the "trip entity" owes you the value of those assets.
(The liability is on the part of the trip entity.)

The total of the expense accounts has been balanced against the equity
accounts of all the participants. This was done in a manner similar to
what was done for the fixed assets:
All the (typically Dr) expense entries were added up, that sum was
entered as a Cr entry in account 5001, which in turn was balanced by
equal Dr entries in each of the participants equity accounts.

The equity accounts reflect how much of your initial investment
remains (which presumably will be refunded with a check from the
treasurer (or, if negative, how much you owe, in which case I expect the
treasurer would appreciate a check from you fro that amount.)

I believe this all to be in keeping with standard double entry book
keeping said to first have been devised by Franciscan friar Luca
Pacioli [1] (although there is some contoversy as to who was truely the
first to come up with the system [2].)

Other items that might be of interest:
1. Hauling the gear from Bolinas to Winnipeg:
    It proved to be only a three day journey each way.
    The return journey was by a different route to accommodate Keith's
    plans to visit friends in the mid West but it turns out that the 
    distance was little different, in fact a bit less although keep in
    mind that the inbound distance includes all the driving I did during
    the 5 days I spent in Winnipeg before others began arriving.
    Bolinas to Winnipeg: 2142mi, fuel cost US$419.84
    Winnipeg to Bolinas: 2101mi, .............392.51
    Totals               4243                 812.35

    Miles per gallon came in at 15.88 which is pretty good given that I
    was pulling a lot of weight in the trailer and that I generally get
    about 17mi/USGal.  Also, there was more in the tank when I returned
    than when I left which would make the true figure even higher.
