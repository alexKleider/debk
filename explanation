EXPLANATION:
Journal entries appear immediately following this explanation. After
that can be found the ledger- The Chart of Accounts, with each entry
cross referenced to the corresponding journal entry.
Each account is specified as either a place holder (heading) account or
a total is provided.  Accounts with a number (8, 9 or 10) following the
total, are those that have been balanced against the specified number of
participants. This is done by using special accounts 1501, 5001 & 5002
as described in the next two paragraphs.

The value of canoes and other "fixed assets" is reflected in the 
liability accounts of the eight participants who 'bought' them.
This was done by adding all the (typically Dr) fixed asset entries,
entering that sum as a Cr entry in account 1501 with a balancing Dr
entry distributed evenly among the Liability accounts of the 'group
of 8' who are now owners of these assets.  Do not be alarmed by the
word "liability."  This does not mean a liability born by you.
It means that the "trip entity" owes you the value of those assets.
(The liability is on the part of the trip entity.)

The total of the expense accounts has been balanced against the equity
accounts. This was done in a manner similar to what was done for the
fixed assets:
All the (typically Dr) expense entries were added up into one of two
sums (depending on whether the item is to be split 9 or 10 ways.) Those
sums were entered as Cr entries in either account 5001 or 5002, which
in turn were balanced by equal Dr entries in each of the participants'
equity accounts. By way of further explanation:
This was done separately for expence accounts which involved everyone,
and those involving only nine participants.  (Rick made many of his
payments directly in Canadian funds.)

Your equity account less the amount in your liability account, reflects
how much of your initial investment remains.  This presumably will be
refunded with a check from the treasurer (or, if it is negative, it
represents how much you still owe, in which case I'm sure the treasurer
would appreciate a check from you for that amount.)

I believe this all to be in keeping with standard double entry book
keeping said to first have been devised by Franciscan friar Luca
Pacioli [1] (although there is some contoversy as to who was truely the
first to come up with the system [2].)

Other items that might be of interest:
1. Hauling the gear from Bolinas to Winnipeg:
    It proved to be only a three day journey each way.
    The return journey was by a different route to accommodate Keith's
    plans to visit friends in the mid West but it turns out that the 
    distance was little different, in fact a bit less although keep in
    mind that the inbound distance includes all the driving I did during
    the 5 days I spent in Winnipeg before others began arriving.
    Bolinas to Winnipeg: 2142mi, fuel cost US$419.84
    Winnipeg to Bolinas: 2101mi, .............392.51
    Totals               4243                 812.35

    Miles per gallon came in at 15.88 which is pretty good given that I
    was pulling a lot of weight in the trailer and that I generally get
    about 17mi/USGal.  Also, there was more in the tank when I returned
    than when I left which would make the true figure even higher.
