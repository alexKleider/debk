# Double Entry Book Keeping

**debk.py** is a simple collection of utilities to facilitate double entry
book keeping.  It was inspired by Glen Jarvis who is is working on a
much more sophisticated version.

A major design decision (championed by Glen) is to keep all the data
files in text format (csv or json) to allow direct editing.  It is
**not** suitable for the naive user.
